# Multitasking-in-Divided-Attention
Attention, in psychology is the concentration of awareness on some phenomenon to the exclusion of other stimuli. Attention is best described as the sustained focus of cognitive resources on information while filtering or ignoring extraneous information.

Divided-attention could be defined as our brainâ€™s ability to attend to two different stimuli at the same time, and respond to the multiple demands of your surroundings. Divided attention is a type of simultaneous attention that allows us to process different information sources and successfully carry out multiple tasks at a time. When you divide your attention, the efficiency with which you do these actions is decreased, and you will almost certainly perform poorly. Interference is the term used to describe when a person has a hard time attending to two stimuli at a time. We see interference when the brain is only able to process a certain amount of information. However, cognitive training can help improve divided attention, and as a consequence, the ability to do more than one activity at a time.
